NEU Game Programming Final Project

Crumbs Banks, notorious for running his own space rock smuggling ring, wants to expand his empire with a plan for world domination using mysterious goo and his robot henchmen. As a new but skilled agent of S.P.A.C.E, a.k.a the Super Private Assassination Conglomerate Enterprise, you must complete your training by rescuing fellow agent Cell Prime and destroying nefarious goo pods before taking out Crumbs Banks once and for all.

Use the WASD or arrow keys to move, the mouse to aim your grapplehand, left mouse click to shoot the hand out, and shift to crouch/sneak.
